# 🛰️ Telstra SOC Team Cybersecurity Simulation – Forage

This repository showcases my participation in the **Telstra SOC Team Cybersecurity Virtual Experience** on Forage. This hands-on simulation allowed me to step into the role of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, gaining practical skills in security monitoring, threat analysis, and incident documentation.

## 🧠 Key Tasks Completed

- **Real-Time Alert Monitoring:**  
  Monitored simulated SIEM alerts to detect potential threats, including suspicious logins, malware behavior, and network anomalies.

- **Log Analysis:**  
  Examined log files to correlate security events and identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) across systems.

- **Incident Triage and Escalation:**  
  Applied a structured triage process to evaluate alert severity and escalate high-risk events to senior analysts.

- **Security Reporting:**  
  Created detailed incident reports summarizing the nature of the threat, affected systems, and mitigation steps.
